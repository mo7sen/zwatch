# zwatch

## Overview

This is a tower-defense post-apocalyptic survival game built using the godot
game engine.

## Brief Description

You're in a watchtower. You got a revolver, some ammo, some food and waves of
zombies coming straight at you.

*"Shooting is loud"* is basically the main mechanic of the game. The more
bullets you use to clear a wave, the more zombies there'll be in the next one.

## Note
Models and art used in this game are bundled with the git repository. However,
we kind of forgot where we got it from. So if you find something you made, we'd
be happy with curating you or, if want to, remove the asset you made.
